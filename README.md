# Change Counter

## Description
This app is for people who have dyscalculia, or trouble counting change. The user enters how many of each coin and bill they have. Their total is displayed so they know if they have enough money for the item(s) they're buying.

## Technologies Used
- React
- React-Redux
- Redux-Saga
- Axios
- Nodejs
- PostgreSQL

## Installation
- Download or clone this repository
- Run 'npm install' from the command line
- Set up the database, I recommend using Postico
- 'npm run server' and 'npm run client' run the program

## Future Plans
- Add user authentication
- Make an area to enter prices of items being purchased, display that total
- Make modifications based on user feedback
- Dry out the code more
